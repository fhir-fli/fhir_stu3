/// operator (such as Câ€™s ? : operator).
/// The criterion expression is expected to evaluate to a Boolean.
/// See: http://hl7.org/fhirpath/#singleton-evaluation-of-collections for rules
/// of Boolean evaluation.
/// Any collection with a single non-boolean item is true.
///
/// If criterion is true, the function returns the value of the true-result
/// argument.
/// If criterion is false or an empty collection, the function returns
/// otherwise-result, unless the optional otherwise-result is not given, in
/// which case the function returns an empty collection.
/// Note that short-circuit behavior is expected in this function. In other
/// words, true-result should only be evaluated if the criterion evaluates to
/// true, and otherwise-result should only be evaluated otherwise. For
/// implementations, this means delaying evaluation of the arguments.
